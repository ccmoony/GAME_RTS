## ðŸ“š Story
  On the serene island of Elaria, life was peaceful under the shadow of Castle Veylmore, a symbol of unity and strength. Villagers thrived among lush fields and ancient forests, untouched by war for generations. But at dawn, dark sails appeared on the horizon, bringing destruction and chaos. Ruthless invaders stormed the shores, seeking the legendary Heartstone hidden beneath the castle. As flames consumed the land and hope waned, you, a young guardian of Veylmore, must rise. Rally the people, defend your home, and uncover the islandâ€™s ancient power before it falls to the enemyâ€™s hands. The battle begins now.
